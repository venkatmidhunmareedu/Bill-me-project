# Bill Me
Bill Me is a web application designed to help shopkeepers easily manage their billing process and keep track of customer transactions. It eliminates the need for traditional paper-based billing systems, ensuring that bills are never lost or unavailable. This project was specifically developed to address the challenges faced by shopkeepers like my dad, who often rely on handwritten bills that can easily be misplaced.

# Features
## Billing: 
Users can create bills for customers, including item details and pricing. The application provides an intuitive interface for adding items to the bill and calculating the total amount. Once the bill is finalized, it can be printed or sent via WhatsApp in a text format.

## History: 
The home section of the application stores all the bills created by the user. This enables easy access to past transactions, allowing shopkeepers to quickly retrieve information about previous sales and track customer purchases.

## Lend Section:
Bill Me provides a dedicated section for recording the amount lent to customers. Users can easily track the outstanding amounts owed by individual customers. This feature helps shopkeepers keep a record of pending payments and follow up with customers as needed.

## Borrow Section: 
Similarly, Bill Me includes a borrow section for tracking the amount borrowed from customers. This feature is useful when shopkeepers need to keep track of credit transactions or loans given to customers.

## Todo Section: 
Shopkeepers can create a to-do list specifically for their shop. They can list the items they need to purchase or tasks they need to complete. This feature helps in managing inventory and ensures that necessary supplies are replenished in a timely manner.

# Usage
## Registration: 
To use Bill Me, users need to create an account. The registration feature allows new users to sign up by providing their basic information and choosing a secure password.

## Login:
Once registered, users can log in to their accounts using their credentials. This step ensures that each user has access to their personalized data and can securely manage their shop's information.

## Navigation: 
The top navigation bar provides access to different sections of the application, including Home, History, Lend, Borrow, and Todo. Users can easily switch between sections to perform specific tasks or view relevant information.

## Logout: 
When the user is done using Bill Me, they can log out of their account to ensure the security of their data. The logout feature terminates the active session and requires users to reauthenticate when accessing the application again.
